        <h3 class="metal-text">üöΩ The Toilet Demon</h3>
        <p>In the <span class="metal-text">Babylonian magico-medical tradition</span>, ≈†ulak was known as the <strong>"lurker of the bathroom"</strong> or the <strong>"demon of the privy."</strong> This ancient entity was no ordinary spirit - he was a predator who waited in the most vulnerable moments.</p>
        
        <p>Ancient texts describe ≈†ulak as a <span class="metal-text">rampant bipedal demon</span> who would strike when humans were at their most exposed. The Babylonian Diagnostic Handbook warned: <em>"When a man attends to excretory functions, he is vulnerable - <strong>≈†ulak will hit him!</strong>"</em></p>
        
        <h3 class="metal-text">‚ö° The Striker</h3>
        <p>Known by the terrifying epithet <strong>"The Hitter"</strong> or <strong>"The Striker,"</strong> ≈†ulak was believed to cause paralysis, strokes, and epilepsy. Ancient folk etymology claimed his name meant <span class="metal-text">"dirty hands"</span> due to his dwelling in the <em>bƒ´t mus√¢ti</em> - literally the "house of rinse-water."</p>
        
        <h3 class="metal-text">üõ°Ô∏è Ancient Protection</h3>
        <p>So feared was this demon that Babylonians buried protective amulets and cuneiform tablets inscribed with anti-≈†ulak spells in their bathroom doorways and drainage pipes. The lion centaur <span class="metal-text">Urmahlullu</span> was especially favored as protection against his wrath.</p>
        
        <p><strong>From ancient Babylon to modern DFW</strong> - we channel the primal fear and raw power of this legendary entity. When nature calls, <span class="metal-text">≈†ulak answers with brutal metal.</span> ü§ò</p>
